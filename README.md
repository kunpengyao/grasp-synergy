# Grasp Synergy ROS package

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/felixduvallet/grasp-synergy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/felixduvallet/grasp-synergy)

This package implements grasp synergies (aka eigengrasps): low-dimensional
representation of hand configurations.

Very basically, grasp synergies are computed by doing PCA on a bunch of hand
configurations (joint angles) to infer a low-dimensional representation.

Points in this low-dimensional space can then be reprojected to the full
configuration space to control the hand.

This ROS package is independent of any hand configuration.
It consists of two components:
 - the GraspSynergy class: compute & store synergies from high-dimensional grasp
   configurations, and compute grasps from low-dimensional input.
 - the synergy_node: ROS magic to provide nice interfaces for controlling grasp
   synergies.

## grasp_synergy

Grasp Synergies (aka eigengrasps) are just low-dimensional representations of
the grasp learned using PCA.

The GraspSynergy class is just a convenience class for computing, storing, and
commanding grasp synergies. It is hand-agnostic.

Grasping data can be of any form:
 - A numpy matrix of joint values (N by D)
 - A list of sensor_msgs/JointState messages
 - A filepath to a rosbag file.

Here N are the number of collected grasps and D is the full dimensionality of
the hand. We extract all D principal components (synergies), but in practice we
will only use a smaller number.

To compute a grasp (in the original space), simply pass in a B-dimensional
vector of coefficients to `compute_grasp`. (Nominally, B < D.) The method will
automatically figure out how many components to use, and return the
corresponding grasp configuration in the original D-dimensional space.

## synergy_node

The synergy node enables you to load a grasp synergy space, create subscribers
for the synergy space, and publish desired joint state messages to control the
hand.
It creates one top-level subscriber for fully-specified coefficient vector and
many per-component subscribers for each component (each for a single value).

Each time the node receives a new low-dimensional (synergy-space) point, it
computes the hand configuration and publishes a message with the desired joint
states.

**Subscribers:**
The node can create a variable number of subscribers: one for the
fully-specified coefficient vector, and one per component (with singleton
values).
By default, the node is trained using a bag file of hand configuration data.

So for example, you might have the following subscribers for 5 synergies:
```
 * /grasp_synergy [std_msgs/Float32MultiArray]
 * /grasp_synergy/syn_0 [std_msgs/Float32]
 * /grasp_synergy/syn_1 [std_msgs/Float32]
 * /grasp_synergy/syn_2 [std_msgs/Float32]
 * /grasp_synergy/syn_3 [std_msgs/Float32]
```

This enables you to use tools like `rqt_ez_publisher`
(http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_ez_publisher) to provide a nice slider GUI interface to
the synergy space:

NOTE: Due to a small [bug](https://github.com/OTL/rqt_ez_publisher/issues/17) in
rqt_ez_publisher, if you want to use the sliders to control the individual
synergies (/grasp_synergy/syn_N) you need to use the latest rqt_ez_publisher
(checkout directly from github into your workspace and run the local copy).


**Publisher:**
The desired joint state topic must be given.
